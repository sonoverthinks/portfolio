#### 📌 Handling Unhandled Routes

- Catch all requests to undefined routes and return a `404` error.
- This should be placed **at the very end** of the middleware stack, after all route handlers.

👉 **Example**:

```js
jsCopyEditapp.all("*", (req, res) => {
  res.status(404).json({ error: "Route not found" }); // No need for next() here
});
```

Here’s the rewritten note with added details in your preferred format:

#### 📌 Types of Errors

- Operational Errors - predictable issues that can occur in real-world usage. These are typically handled in advance to prevent crashes. Examples:
  - Invalid path access
  - Failing to connect to the database
  - Request timeouts
  - Authentication failures
- Programming Error: - bugs introduced by developers. These are usually caused by mistakes in the code that lead to unexpected behavior. Examples:
  - Reading properties of `undefined`
  - Incorrectly handling data types
  - Logic errors causing incorrect calculations

#### 📌 Error Middleware

- In Express, **operational errors** are usually handled by an **error-handling middleware**. This middleware catches errors and sends appropriate responses to the client.

1️⃣ **Typical Error Middleware**

```js
const errorMiddleware = (err, req, res, next) => {
  // The error-handling middleware must accept **four parameters** `(err, req, res, next)` to properly handle errors.
  let statusCode = err.statusCode || 500;
  let message = err.message || "Server Error";

  // Handle Mongoose bad ObjectId error
  if (err.name === "CastError") {
    message = "Resource not found";
    statusCode = 404;
  }
  // handle other errors..

  // Send the error response
  res.status(statusCode).json({
    success: false,
    error: message,
  });
};

export default errorMiddleware;
```

2️⃣ **Important Points**

- **Error Middleware**: Always placed at the **end of the middleware stack** to catch any unhandled errors.
- **Operational vs. Programming Errors**: While operational errors should be handled gracefully with proper responses, programming errors might require fixing the code to prevent crashes.

Here’s a structured note about **HTTP Status Codes** and a table of commonly used ones in Express:

#### 📌 HTTP Status Codes

HTTP status codes are standard responses returned by the server to indicate the result of a client’s request. They are categorized into five classes:

1️⃣ **1xx - Informational**: These codes indicate that the request has been received and is being processed.

2️⃣ **2xx - Success**: These codes indicate that the request was successfully processed.

3️⃣ **3xx - Redirection**: These codes indicate that further action is needed to complete the request.

4️⃣ **4xx - Client Errors**: These codes indicate that there was an error in the client’s request (e.g., invalid data or missing parameters).

5️⃣ **5xx - Server Errors**: These codes indicate that there was an issue with the server processing the request.

#### 📌Common Status Codes

| **Status Code**               | **Description**                                                       | **When to Use**                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **200 OK**                    | The request was successful.                                           | When a request is successfully processed.                                                         |
| **201 Created**               | The request has been fulfilled and a new resource was created.        | When creating a new resource, e.g., new user or item.                                             |
| **204 No Content**            | The request was successful, but there is no content to return.        | When no data needs to be sent back (e.g., for DELETE).                                            |
| **400 Bad Request**           | The request cannot be processed due to client error.                  | When the client sends invalid data or bad parameters.                                             |
| **401 Unauthorized**          | Authentication is required and has failed or has not been provided.   | When a user needs to log in but hasn’t or failed authentication.                                  |
| **403 Forbidden**             | The client does not have permission to access the resource.           | When a user tries to access a resource they are not allowed to.                                   |
| **404 Not Found**             | The requested resource could not be found.                            | When the route or resource does not exist.                                                        |
| **405 Method Not Allowed**    | The HTTP method used is not allowed for the requested resource.       | When a client tries to access a resource using an invalid HTTP method (e.g., PUT on a GET route). |
| **500 Internal Server Error** | A generic error message when something goes wrong on the server side. | When an unexpected error occurs on the server.                                                    |
| **503 Service Unavailable**   | The server is temporarily unavailable, often due to maintenance.      | When the server is down or temporarily unavailable.                                               |

- When returning error responses in Express, use `res.status(code).json()`.

#### 📌 Passing Errors from a Route to Error Middleware

1️⃣ **How to Pass Errors**

- Use the `next()` function with the error object inside route handlers or other middleware.
- Express will then forward the error to the next error-handling middleware, where you can handle it appropriately (e.g., send a response to the client).

👉 **Example**:

```js
// Route that throws an error
app.get("/example", (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    // Simulate an error
    throw new Error("Something went wrong!");
  } catch (error) {
    next(error); // Pass the error to the error-handling middleware
  }
});
```
